# pliancy

malleable gists

* `ahoy/` onboarding
* `docs/` templates for reports
* `gtd/` reviews and task triage
* `domain/` fintech reading material
* `gtd/` organization, planning, reviewing
* `job/` expectations set here
* `tech/` cheat sheets and general technical documentation

Use this repo to keep track of all non-confidential material.

Directory structure elsewhere

* `~/Projects/` for other version controlled projects
* `~/Google Drive/` for collaboration documentation
* subdirectories of the above should match to link technical with non-tech

Supplemental projects are

* [dotfiles](https://github.com/mattorama/dotfiles/)
* [tufterati](https://github.com/mattorama/tufterati/)
* [trapezion](https://github.com/mattorama/trapezion/)
