Notes about business in `pliancy`

Goal is 40 bps, which on 200 MM volume per month is 8 MM net margin.
Currently at 500K per month net margin

100 x 250K pa is 25 MM pa, so 2 MM per month salaries
2 MM per month in other operating costs

take rate (revenue)
- COGS (discounts)
= gross margin
- promos, ffds, rebates
= net margin (500K)
- op costs (4 MM)
= net profit (-3.5 MM)

68 MM in the bank
June 2020 @ -2.5 MM per month gives 18 months runway

COGS consists of
interchange (170 bps) (bank)
acquirer (20 bps) (vantiv)
assessment (10 bps) (card brand)
fraud, chargebacks (5 bps)
