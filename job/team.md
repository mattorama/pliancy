# notes on team building and roles

Business analyst. Write SQL and create dashboards. No skill requirement in Python. Limited skill requirements of statistics.

Data engineer. No-one in this role in the team today, this lives in engineering. Unlikely to bring the role into the chapter/squad. The result is that the analytics tables are a huge undocumented mess. High risk area.

Data scientist. Not a typical setup today. No version control. No concern with production capacity.

## things to do

Get interns to supervise.

Make more cakes.

Host more knowledge sharing sessions.

## business practices

* weekly share of what we are doing
* annual thank you with major accomplishments shared
* regular demo of the work done
