The world’s economy is formed by small business owners.

As small businesses thrive, the world thrives. Lives are made better, richer, and more connected on a global scale.

Over 30 million small businesses employ nearly 60 million workers; in other words, half of the US workforce is employed by small businesses. Despite this fact, when it comes to financial services, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are always and consistently left behind. It’s time someone fought for them first.

If SMBs are the engine, cash flow is the fuel.

SMBs often struggle with maintaining a healthy cash flow position to grow their business due to limited access to credit, restrictions on current credit instruments, seasonal sales cycles, and limited expertise in cash flow management.

Millions of SMBs fail to reach that next step of growth, and many fall apart. With the average SMB having less than 30 days of cash on hand, adequate cash flow is the inhibitor of success. It also represents their greatest opportunity.

At Xxxxxxx, our mission is to help small businesses achieve their growth potential by helping them best manage their cash flow. Our vision is to be the trusted financial partner that gives an immediate, digital picture of the health of their business and a wide range of curated options to manage and grow it.

Xxxxxxx seeks to accelerate the growth of small business. 

Closer to home, in the US, it is even truer that SMBs are the engine that drive this country forward. 

We at Xxxxxxx are committed to helping small businesses achieve their growth potential. 

We are in a phenomenal position to make that happen, with >1 million customers, SMBs who trust and love us, a product that meets a very real need, and partners that are supportive of our mission. Most importantly, we have the team, the technology and capital to make our vision a reality. By accelerating our own growth potential, we will do so for business owners as well.
