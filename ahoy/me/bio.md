Matt Percival has spent the last decade collaborating with subject matter experts to aid and quantify and automate their decision making processes across various industries, such as medical devices, laboratory diagnostics, and healthcare, having got his start with his doctoral research developing insulin delivery algorithms for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Most recently Matt was at Castlight Health, working as a data scientist within engineering and analytics, where he designed observational experiments and built data pipelines to assess customer ROI. Prior to that, Matt wore many hats as a software engineer at Riffyn, a SaaS startup company aiming to solve the reproducibility crisis in the life sciences, where he built a low-latency data pipeline for automating common yet time-consuming data wrangling tasks.

Matt also enjoys backpacking and cycle-touring, so much so that he has traversed the United States in doing so. He spends much of his time outside work entertaining and being entertained by his three year old son. He also enjoys learning about how obscure IRS guidance notices are applicable to him.
