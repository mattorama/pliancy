2019-12-13

done: presented at showandtell
done: got some feature insights from Mark Centoni
next: clean up daily forecast and goal

last minute ask to present at showandtell... surprise!

2019-12-12

done: presented model
next: productionize model

bizarre micro managing of modeling effort: picking one data point to influence decision because it represents an opposing theory
flies in the face of statistics
demoralizing comment about using both models
how are you going to choose between the two models?

2019-12-11

done:
done: long one-on-one discussion about scaling forecast to monthly goal
next:

more implicit criticism of me for preparing slides

2019-12-10

done: GAM model with holidays
next:

offered to carry pizza back from costco after my boss took us out for hotdogs and they made jokes about me behind my back
one-on-one she criticized me again about making different slides for the meetings she instructed me to hold, while still not understanding how long anything took
one-on-one she micro-managed and instructed me to manually create a set of tables; as if I don't know that is possible; disgusted by the idea that this activity is a good use of time
one-on-one she ignored what I said multiple times and got frustrated and confused about model fitting metrics and holdout, not understanding what metric was being used
one-on-one she again moves the goal posts for the forecasting project and refuses to state the goal of the project, despite me asking from day one multiple times what the objective is

later on she commented that I am doing well so shouldn't feel pressure to stay late; I thanked her

definite tendency to discourage initiative and focus on micro-management rather than results
this is based on the amount of time spent criticizing my decision on tailoring my presentation to each different group of people

2019-12-09

done: GAM model set up
next:

moved into new desk
first Nwokedi tells me that he is going to take my monitors
then Wen-Ying just takes the plants from my desk without asking, saying "I have had my eyes on them" laughing
rude person calls me "Michael"
company announcement says I am "Matt Pervial"
Wen-Ying agreed last week that we would discuss feasibility before committing, but instead this week she commits me to delivery without confirming
put the rest of the plants on Wen-Ying's desk, which she scoffed at

2019-12-06

done: slides, rehearsal, followups, and presentation at company showandtell
done: dashboard of plots for holiday volume hypothesis
done: followups from showandtell
next: daily forecast with exogeny and multiple seasonality

2019-12-05

done: interviewed candidate
done: prepared data set with exogenous features for daily forecasting
done: plotted holiday residuals
done: compliance training
done: presented to Ella at Analytics Knowledge Share
next: prepare for company show and tell
next: plots of holiday volumes and surrounding days for all time

weird, harassing criticism via slack
apparently in presenting the modeling to the team as requested and at knowledge share I am spending too long on it
i asked how long i should be spending on it, no response
despite her actually asking me to do this
apparently my request for five minutes was wrong as well
asked multiple times for what I think and told I am wrong on each occasion

2019-12-04

done: residual analysis by holiday day type
done: refactor date features views
done: snowflake training
done: analytics knowledge share prep
next: more plots around historical holiday volume
next: monthly forecasting slides and presentation
next: compliance training
next: statistician interview
next: set up exogenous features and data for forecasting tools as csvs

weird, untrusting interruption during the weekly team meeting
she said she would dial in, but did not
then she interrupted stopping the meeting to check in on us

2019-12-03

done: productionized monthly forecast
done: advertized analytics knowledge share
done: sought github access for periscope python custom modules
next: holiday hypothesis data
next: prepare materials for knowledge share

periscope views routinely fail to load

2019-12-02

done: december forecast updated and shared with rohit
done: parameterized dates in monthly forecast code
next: productionize monthly forecast

database is very slow to return small selects

2019-11-27

done: dashboard for november and december forecast presented to wenying and rohit
next: productionize dashboard for auto update

2019-11-26

done: long tables for date features for projects
done: plans for holiday hypothesis
done: plans for monthly forecast and initial fitting
next: monthly forecast cross validation and dashboard for december monthly forecast

weird comment about me confirming objectives with her
she thought she should "leave me alone"
i confirmed i would rather we are aligned on expectations

2019-11-25

done: wide tables of date features for business days and holidays
done: phone screening
next: long tables joined with date features

asked "what do you think" and response to my opinion was "OK" with face pulled
later I apologized for my misinterpretation and before I had finished speaking was talked over, incorrectly, as I hadn't finished my statement

2019-11-22

done: sarima, holt-winters, naive model exploration
done: existing model evaluation
next: exogenous features

2019-11-21

done: periscope tutorials
done: project setup for analysis
next: time series analysis

received apology for pressure
received acknowledgment that i am new (but don't seem that way)
received acknowledgment that getting settled in takes some time

2019-11-20

done: scored internship candidates and reviewed with team
next: one pager on time series analysis

brief discussion about projects
i was asked if i thought i should continue on time series project
face pulled when i said i didn't know if i would have a result

0. timebox the exploration to november
1. gather evidence on holiday hypothesis
2. implement holiday hypothesis if the evidence says it is beneficial
3. explore other other elegant modeling solutions

2019-11-19

done: create a postit note map of tables required for generating goal table
done: created scoring sheet for intern positions
done: got data set for baseline aggregate time series model
next: get volume by vertical, go through time series analysis

2019-11-18

done: basic periscope charts, industry category data gathered, set up proper database access with psql, figured out values problem with old database
next: basic time series models, split data by industry of payment

periscope lost my charts
the tool is just a jumble of garbage with my work mixed in
i need to see code in a text editor
i need to be able to run code without superfluous junk on the screen
i need to use tools that do not interfere with doing work

2019-11-15

done: onboarding meetings, periscope tutorials, analyst task, data connections, public speaking for analytics
next: periscope examples, writeup daily goal baseline, benchmark baseline model

no comprehension of what a benchmark model is
told by my manager that we are "collaborating"
more comparison of my PTO with that of my manager, but apology received

2019-11-14

done: onboarding meetings, finished laptop setup, discuss project
next: onboarding meetings, run sql and python code relating to TUTV

negative reaction to the PTO that I had raised as a matter to consider
stories told by my manager about her PTO

2019-11-13

done: onboarding meetings, TUTV forecasting project intro, some laptop setup, periscope intro
next: onboarding meetings, more periscope intro, grab data for TUTV, more laptop setup

told to use periscope
not trusted enough to have access to the database

2019-11-12

done: onboarding meetings, scheduling wen-ying, some laptop setup
next: more onboarding meetings, periscipe tutorial, more laptop setup

told "no, that's not true" when I asked a question and presented a fact
effectively told that i was a liar
aggression was undignified
no desk
positioned where my manager is looking over my shoulder constantly: no trust
