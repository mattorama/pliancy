went over limitations of periscope/python modeling

was asked to create ticket/epic for data science environment set up
needs to be free

create a ticket for scoring mechanism with mark

discussed modeling results

"solid analysis"
"look at dollar value": done
"value better than touch": done

TODO: split leads by A, B, C, D
TODO: look at self-serve scores
TODO: update model report document to include call to action

"emails could lead to self-serve"

consider looking at show and tell this Friday

2020-02-04

* lead scoring

reviewed modeling results
pipeline review for robustness

we will refer users once only
rolling window for robustness evaluation (3,6,9,12 month trailing data, 12 fold)


2020-01-28

* lead scoring

uptick in average time to activate due to winback campaign for registered
there are details to how smb is identified and differs from self identification
todo: check on various smb identification fields
assume lead score is current value of lead
todo: find where to get lead score from
understand distinction between referred and touched
AEs touch about 150 leads a day
committed to Feb 3 for delivery of model evaluation

* other stuff

she brought up title adjustment and we concluded the change should be made
she thinks I won't get a salary adjustment for another year
conversation was reasonable

2020-01-22

* lead scoring

discussed modeling in depth

* other stuff

asked again about joining and whether I thought it was a good choice


2020-01-14

* forecasting

new squad definition snippet
built 30 day pipeline
talk through residual analysis
https://app.periscopedata.com/app/plastiq/581204/mwp-tutv-90-30-daily-monthly-forecast-residuals

ask: share with Rohit and Sameer
ask: why tighter error bound? because shift to SMBs 70% volume 30% users

* lead scoring

where is the activation aid score plugged in?
sequence of scores: firmographics, registration, activation

* phase 1:
  1. self-serve score
  2. response score (how to model the response to touch?)
  3. LTV score
* phase 2:
  4. combine the scores for optimal EMV score

wenying to send me features
wenying to send me touch experiment

ask: develop timeline for lead scoring first round deliverable
ask: deliverable is EAV table that "Sean" will plug in to Salesforce

2020-01-10

celebrate fix to monthly and daily forecast based on new segments
announce preparation for activation date time change (one number)
discuss lead scoring project and goals

misunderstanding about production...
... appears to be resolved
instead of guessing goal, just use forecast...
... goal expected on Monday

SG wants historic forecasts/goals kept each month...
... roll this into the storage script

Wen-Ying wants Alex to update the Squad Goal Overview dashboard with goal...
... meet with him to discuss how

Wen-Ying has a different view on which leads Mark's team touches...
... apparently some are hidden and some are untouched

2019-12-10

we were late back from lunch and she disappeared
she abruptly forced the conversation to be about cleaning up after her dog
more criticism for making using different slides for meetings with different audiences
micromanagement about blockers
2 hours go by, generally nothing constructive
complete absence of seeking to understand

2019-12-03

cancelled without any acknowledgment
she doesn't know how to use her calendar to set expectations

2019-11-26

o3 topics
interviewing candidates: learned what standards are reasonable
holiday hypothesis: produced augmented date features table for project to share
monthly adhoc forecast: fitted time series model
great, shared with rohit
monthly adhoc forecast: what is the delivery medium?
periscope dashboard
sharing results: how to share html reports?
i decided jira
sharing results: how to push a trained python model to a view?
i figured out this is in periscope
will push lead scoring to 2020
take next week to see where daily forecast is going

thank you for the pto approval
thank you for the opportunity to speak and introduce myself
gave feedback that the onboarding was good
gave feedback that the facilities make the commute good
gave feedback that I was unclear on the objective of the project and we resolved it later on

2019-11-14

are you out next week Tu-Th? yes
objectives for TUTV project, what does success look like?
success is getting to know the data model and running some code by the end of November
we discussed what I would need to get the job done

2019-11-13

TUTV daily goal logic update (turn up the volume)
